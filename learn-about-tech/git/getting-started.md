# Getting Started

## What you need

Install Git here: https://www.git-scm.com/downloads

GitHub account here: https://github.com/

## Setting up Git

On Windows open up the Git Bash application. On Linux or OSX open up a terminal.

Set up your name and the email you used for your GitHub account.

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name Here"

git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"
```

## Create local repository

Navigate to where you want the projects to be on your computer.

```
cd path/to/where/you/want/the/code
```

## New Project

Make a folder with the name of the Project

```
mkdir Project-Name
```

**git init** - This will create a new Git repository in the current directory.
```
git init
```

## Project from GitHub

Copy the url from the repository you want on your computer.

**git clone** - This will create a copy of the designated repository on your computer.

```
git clone https://github.com/ufosc/practice-repo.git
```

### Updating

**git fetch** - Checks if there are updates from a specific branch. It doesn't change anything on your local branch.

```
git fetch origin master
```

**git merge** - This merges changes from the branch specified to your current branch.

```
git merge origin master
```

Always update before trying to commit code

### Status

**git status** - To get the current status of your staged and committed files. It will also show you how many commit ahead or behind the remote repo at the time of your last `git fetch`.

```
git status
```

This is useful to run before starting to commit anything.

### Committing

**git add** - This tells Git you want to stage or add specific files to a branch, this does not actually commit anything.

```
git add helloWorld.txt
```

**git commit** - This wraps the added files with a message ready to push up to the branch. It will open up a text editor in the terminal where you can type the message.

```
git commit
```

Update again!

**git push** - This pushes your committed changes to the branch indicated.

```
git push origin master
```

And now you're changes are on the remote repository!
