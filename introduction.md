## About OSC

### What is the OSC?

OSC is the Open Source Club at the University of Florida. We are a community of makers, who want to solve problems and improve our world using open source projects.

We were founded in the Spring of 2016 as an official student organization at UF. The club is also a partnered Special Interest Group of the UF ACM chapter. In the summer of 2017 we helped start the [Mozilla Open Source Student Network](https://opensource.mozilla.community/), a collection of university open source clubs across the country who help students contribute to open source.

### What does the OSC do?

The OSC is first and foremost, about working on open source projects. Student choose what they want to work on, whether it be a totally new idea, or an existing project. Our meetings create a constructive atmosphere to help students collaborate in teams to grow their knowledge and skills!

We also preform technical talks on various open source topics. Anything from Linux to Typescript. Students are encouraged to submit ideas or even volunteer to give a talk. 

Collaborating with other clubs is another one of our goals. We love to work with others on presentations, events, or projects! If you are interested in working together email [gator.osc@gmail.com][OSC Email].

### Who's the OSC for?

If you:
- Are enthusiastic (or want to be enthusiastic) about open source 
- Want to make cool and useful stuff
- Want to improve your community 
- Just want to geek-out with others

Though we primarily work on open source software, you don't have to be a programmer to join. Open source applies to all sorts of fields, and so does this club!

### How to Join

Sign up for our **[email list][Listserv Sign Up]** our **[Facebook group][OSC Facebook]** for meeting announcements and join our **[Discord][OSC Discord]** to communicate with other members and ask questions. And of course, come to our meetings! Introduce yourself, work on projects, and have fun.

## The Basics

### Meetings

We have a couple types of meetings. Check our [Facebook][OSC Facebook] for times and locations.

1. **Casual Coding Sessions** are laid back meetings. You can work on projects, homework, or just hang out! They happen twice weekly. It's a great time to find people with similar interest and create something cool. 
2. **General Body Meetings** (GBMs) open up with a brief round of project updates. Following that, there is a tech talk on an open source technology. This is great for anyone to come in and learn. They happen every other week.
3. **Code Jams** are a once a month workshop and hack sessions. Spend the morning of Saturday learning about an open source technology then in the afternoon work on existing open source projects or start you own!

### Projects

Active projects are official club projects that have an assigned project lead, are given club resources, and are the first projects mentioned to new members. You can find a list of active projects above under the Project Leads section. 

If you have a project idea, add it to our list of [projects][Project List] and pitch it to other members at a meeting. If you get enough interest, we can make it an active project!

You aren't locked into a project either. Feel free to work around and see what interest you. Talk to the project lead and they'll find something for you to do.

## What's Next

### Learn about Open Source

Open Source (and Free Software) is the philosophy that the source code for an program should be: free to study, free to modify, and free to share (plus modifications) with everyone. It encourages open collaboration, pushes technological advancements, and produces software (though it can apply to other fields) that is usually higher quality, more secure, and privacy conscious. For software to be open source, it must have an appropriate license included with it. More on [licenses here][License Resource].

### Working on a Project

We use Git to manage all of our projects. It makes it easy to track code changes and have multiple people work on a project at the same time. Plus it's open source! Find out more about Git and how we use it on GitHub [here][Git Resource]. 

Before working on a project checkout their CONTRIBUTING file. It will explain where you can: find issues, ask questions, read documentation, how to style code, and how to submit changes. You can also ask the project lead for help. 

In addition to the LICENSE and CONTRIBUTING file, you may see a lot of other files that aren't code in a project repository. This [explanation][Explanation] should help describe the different types of files you'll typically find in out open source projects. If you're creating a project, copying the [project template][Project Template] will start you off with all the basic documentation you'll need. 

### Useful Things to Know

- [Markdown][Markdown Resource] is the format we write our documentation files (like this one in). It's an easy way to add styling to plain text.
- [Resources][OSC Resources] is a great place to find information about the club and different technologies we use. It also has our general coding guidelines and project template. It's open source, so feel free to add to it! 
- [Club Documents][OSC Club Documents] is where documents related to running the club are. Such as our constitution, officer duties, and proposals. Check it out if you are interested in becoming an officer.
